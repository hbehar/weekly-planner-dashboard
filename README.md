# Git conventions

### Commits

Only use these prefixes:

- add, remove, update, refactor, fix
  Add detailed commit body as much as possible.
  Squash all commits into one when merging branches. In picked commit add prefix to close issue like closes, fixes.

### Branchs

Create a new branch for each feature and use feature/ prefix for all feature branches.

### Issues

Open an issue for each feature and implementation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
